# Game List Application Project: Front-End

## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to create a functioning front-end CRUD application as a consolidation of learning over the last seven weeks of training. This repository contains the front-end technology and documentation utilised to create and support the creation of the application.

### Front-End Technologies
* **Project Management:** Jira scrum board with user stories, tasks and smart-commits.
* **Front-End Development:** HTML, JavaScript and CSS files with API integration.
* **Version Control:** GitHub for code integration.

## Project Management
To help manage time and ensure the minimum viable product for the user was met, a Jira scrum board was created with epics for each section of the project(_Front-End, Back-End, Testing, Documentation_) with user stories and tasks linked to the relevant epic. Acceptance criteria was added to user stories and tasks, as well as prioritisation and assignees. The sprint for this project was set to one week as that was the allocated time-frame. Smart commits were also utilised to help myself and other potential collaboraters see what changes have been made to specific user stories and tasks.

### Design Planning
To help me visualise what the front-end design could look like I created a basic wireframe and experimented with some potential colour palettes as a guide.

## Front-End Design
To build the front-end, HTML, JavaScript and CSS were used alongside some bootstrap framework options. To integrate the API, the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) open source library was used.

### Colour-Palette
In order to ensure the website was easy to read and didn't have any harsh contrasting colours, I created colour swatches and used these throughout my design for consistency. The overall design resembles a dark-theme with vibrant accent colours.
